# Admin Shipment Management System - Implementation Guide

## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. AdminShipmentsPage (`frontend/src/pages/AdminShipmentsPage.jsx`)
**Features:**
- ✅ Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ✅ Search by tracking number, receiver, email, destination
- ✅ Filter by status (Pending, In Transit, Delivered, etc.)
- ✅ Pagination support
- ✅ Responsive table view
- ✅ Real-time actions: Edit, Update Status, View, Delete
- ✅ Success/Error notifications

### 2. Modal Components (`frontend/src/components/modals/`)
#### UpdateStatusModal.jsx
- Update shipment status
- Change location
- Add notes
- Shows current status for reference

#### EditShipmentModal.jsx
- Edit sender information
- Edit receiver information
- Edit package details
- Validation for required fields
- Clean data handling (omits empty optional fields)

#### DeleteConfirmModal.jsx
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Shows shipment details
- Prevents accidental deletions

## 🔨 To Complete the System

### Step 1: Add Routes
Update `frontend/src/App.jsx` or your routing file:

```javascript
import AdminShipmentsPage from './pages/AdminShipmentsPage'

// Inside your Routes:
<Route path="/admin/shipments" element={
  <PrivateRoute requireAdmin>
    <AdminShipmentsPage />
  </PrivateRoute>
} />
```

### Step 2: Update Navigation
Update `frontend/src/components/Layout.jsx` to add link:

```javascript
{isAdmin && (
  <>
    <Link to="/admin/shipments">
      <Package className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
      Manage Shipments
    </Link>
    <Link to="/admin/create">
      <Plus className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
      Create Shipment
    </Link>
  </>
)}
```

### Step 3: Create User Shipments Page
Create `frontend/src/pages/UserShipmentsPage.jsx`:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { shipmentAPI } from '../lib/api'
// Use similar structure to AdminShipmentsPage but:
// - Remove edit/delete actions
// - Show only user's shipments (backend filters by receiver.email)
// - Add "View Details" button
// - Real-time updates via Socket.IO
```

### Step 4: Real-Time Updates (Optional but Recommended)

#### Frontend Setup:
1. Install socket.io-client:
```bash
npm install socket.io-client
```

2. Create socket context (`frontend/src/contexts/SocketContext.jsx`):
```javascript
import { createContext, useContext, useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import io from 'socket.io-client'
import { useAuth } from './AuthContext'

const SocketContext = createContext()

export const SocketProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [socket, setSocket] = useState(null)
  const { user } = useAuth()

  useEffect(() => {
    if (user) {
      const newSocket = io(import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:5000')
      setSocket(newSocket)

      return () => newSocket.close()
    }
  }, [user])

  return (
    <SocketContext.Provider value={socket}>
      {children}
    </SocketContext.Provider>
  )
}

export const useSocket = () => useContext(SocketContext)
```

3. Listen for updates in UserShipmentsPage:
```javascript
const socket = useSocket()

useEffect(() => {
  if (socket) {
    socket.on('shipment:update', (data) => {
      // Update shipment in state
      setShipments(prev => prev.map(s => 
        s.trackingNumber === data.trackingNumber ? data.shipment : s
      ))
      // Show notification
      setNotification(`Shipment ${data.trackingNumber} updated!`)
    })
  }
}, [socket])
```

## 📋 Current Backend Support

The backend already supports all required operations:

### ✅ Admin Endpoints (Already Working)
```
POST   /api/shipments              - Create shipment
GET    /api/shipments              - List all shipments (admin sees all)
GET    /api/shipments/:id          - Get shipment by ID
PUT    /api/shipments/:id/update   - Update status & location
PUT    /api/shipments/:id/details  - Update shipment details
DELETE /api/shipments/:id          - Delete shipment
```

### ✅ User Endpoints (Already Working)
```
GET    /api/shipments              - List user's shipments (filtered by receiver.email)
GET    /api/shipments/:id          - Get user's shipment
GET    /api/shipments/tracking/:trackingNumber - Public tracking
```

### ✅ Real-Time Support
Socket.IO is already configured:
- Events: `shipment:update`
- Room-based updates: `tracking:${trackingNumber}`

## 🎯 How It Works

### Admin Workflow:
1. **View All Shipments**
   - Admin navigates to `/admin/shipments`
   - Sees table of all shipments with filters
   - Can search and paginate

2. **Create Shipment**
   - Click "Create Shipment" button
   - Fill form with sender/receiver details
   - Receiver email associates shipment with user
   - System auto-generates tracking number

3. **Update Status**
   - Click MapPin icon on any shipment
   - Select new status and location
   - Add optional note
   - Submit → Updates immediately
   - User sees update in real-time (if Socket.IO enabled)

4. **Edit Details**
   - Click Edit icon on any shipment
   - Modify sender/receiver/package info
   - Save → Updates immediately

5. **Delete Shipment**
   - Click Delete icon
   - Confirm deletion
   - Shipment removed from system

### User Workflow:
1. **View My Shipments**
   - User navigates to `/shipments` or dashboard
   - Sees only shipments where `receiver.email === user.email`
   - Cannot edit or delete

2. **Track Shipment**
   - Click "View" or "Track" on any shipment
   - See full history and current status
   - Real-time updates appear automatically

3. **Receive Updates**
   - When admin updates shipment:
     - Status changes reflect immediately
     - New history entry appears
     - Optional: Email notification sent

## 🔐 Security

Already implemented:
- ✅ JWT authentication required
- ✅ Admin role check for management operations
- ✅ Users can only see their own shipments (`receiver.email` filter)
- ✅ Input validation (Joi + Mongoose)
- ✅ XSS protection
- ✅ Rate limiting

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Shipments not appearing for users:
- Check `receiver.email` matches user's email
- Verify authentication token is valid
- Check backend filtering logic

### Updates not showing in real-time:
- Verify Socket.IO connection
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure Socket.IO URL is correct
- Check server Socket.IO configuration

### 400 errors on create/update:
- Check validation errors in response
- Verify all required fields present
- Check data types (numbers vs strings)
- Review `FIX_400_ERROR.md` and `FIX_TRACKING_NUMBER_REQUIRED.md`
