# Fix for 400 Bad Request Error on Shipment Creation

## Issue
When trying to create a shipment through the frontend form, the request was failing with a 400 Bad Request error.

## Root Cause
The issue was in how the `CreateShipmentPage.jsx` handled optional fields:

### Before (Problematic Code):
```javascript
const shipmentData = {
  ...formData,
  packageDetails: {
    ...formData.packageDetails,
    weight: formData.packageDetails.weight ? parseFloat(formData.packageDetails.weight) : undefined,
    value: formData.packageDetails.value ? parseFloat(formData.packageDetails.value) : undefined,
    dimensions: {
      length: formData.packageDetails.dimensions.length ? parseFloat(...) : undefined,
      width: formData.packageDetails.dimensions.width ? parseFloat(...) : undefined,
      height: formData.packageDetails.dimensions.height ? parseFloat(...) : undefined
    }
  }
}
```

**Problem:** This code was sending objects with `undefined` values like:
```json
{
  "packageDetails": {
    "weight": undefined,
    "value": undefined,
    "dimensions": {
      "length": undefined,
      "width": undefined,
      "height": undefined
    }
  }
}
```

When serialized to JSON, these `undefined` values were being handled inconsistently, and Joi validation might have been receiving incomplete objects.

## Solution
Changed the code to **completely omit** empty optional fields rather than setting them to `undefined`:

### After (Fixed Code):
```javascript
// Only include fields that have actual values
const shipmentData = {
  sender: {
    name: formData.sender.name,
    phone: formData.sender.phone,
    address: formData.sender.address,
    ...(formData.sender.email && { email: formData.sender.email })
  },
  receiver: {
    name: formData.receiver.name,
    email: formData.receiver.email,
    phone: formData.receiver.phone,
    address: formData.receiver.address
  },
  origin: formData.origin,
  destination: formData.destination,
  ...(formData.priority && { priority: formData.priority }),
  ...(formData.estimatedDelivery && { estimatedDelivery: formData.estimatedDelivery })
}

// Only include packageDetails if at least one field has a value
if (hasPackageDetails) {
  shipmentData.packageDetails = {}
  
  if (formData.packageDetails.weight) {
    shipmentData.packageDetails.weight = parseFloat(formData.packageDetails.weight)
  }
  // ... etc
}
```

**Now sends clean data:**
```json
{
  "sender": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "address": "123 Main St"
  },
  "receiver": {
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "phone": "+0987654321",
    "address": "456 Oak Ave"
  },
  "origin": "New York, NY",
  "destination": "Los Angeles, CA"
}
```

Note: `packageDetails` is completely omitted if all fields are empty, which is valid per the Joi schema.

## Additional Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
Also improved error display to show field-level validation errors:

```javascript
if (err.response?.data?.errors && Array.isArray(err.response.data.errors)) {
  const errorMessages = err.response.data.errors
    .map(e => `${e.field}: ${e.message}`)
    .join(', ')
  setError(`Validation failed: ${errorMessages}`)
}
```

This will now show errors like:
```
Validation failed: receiver.email: "receiver.email" is required, sender.address: "sender.address" is required
```

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/CreateShipmentPage.jsx`
  - Lines 82-150: Restructured shipment data preparation
  - Lines 161-170: Enhanced error handling

## Testing
After this fix:
1. ✅ Frontend builds successfully
2. ✅ Form submits with only required fields
3. ✅ Optional fields are properly omitted when empty
4. ✅ Validation errors are displayed clearly

## How to Test
1. Go to Create Shipment page
2. Fill in only the required fields:
   - Sender: name, phone, address
   - Receiver: name, email, phone, address
   - Origin and destination
3. Leave package details empty
4. Submit form
5. Should create shipment successfully

## Key Takeaways
- ✅ **Never send `undefined` in JSON payloads** - omit the field entirely instead
- ✅ **Use spread operators conditionally** to include optional fields only when they have values
- ✅ **Validate on the frontend** what the backend expects
- ✅ **Display detailed validation errors** to help users fix issues
